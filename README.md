# HWO Processor Performance Spreadsheet Tool
This spreadsheet tool was used for the Chapter 4 results of my PhD thesis "Embedded Computing for Wavefront Control on Future Space Telescopes"
You supply parameters for evaluation and four types of results are generated that relate processor performance to compute requirements. See Chapter 4 of my thesis for discussion and explanation.

## Input
The first sheet contains the input analysis parameters. The columns that affect the what-if analysis results are highlighted in yellow. Edit those columns.

## Results
The next four sheets contain the four types of analysis results. In general, results are presented for HabEx, LUVOIR-A, and the mid-point design.
